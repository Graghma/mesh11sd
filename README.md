## 1. The mesh11sd project

  Mesh11sd is a dynamic parameter configuration daemon for 802.11s mesh networks.

  It was originally designed to leverage 802.11s mesh networking at Captive Portal venues.

  This is the open source version and it enables easy and automated mesh network operation with multiple mesh nodes.

  This version does not require a Captive Portal to be running.

## 2. Overview

**What is a Mesh?**


A mesh network is a multi point to multi point layer 2 mac-routing backhaul used to interconnect mesh peers. Mesh peers are generally non-user devices, such as routers, access points, CPEs etc..

A normal user device, such as a phone, tablet, laptop etc., cannot connect to a mesh network. Instead, connection is achieved via a mesh gateway, a special type of mesh peer.

**WARNING Are you sure you want a mesh?**

If you are looking for a solution to enable your user devices to seamlessly roam from one access point to another in your home, YOU ARE NOT LOOKING FOR A MESH.

It is unfortunate that some manufacturers have used the word “Mesh” for marketing purposes to describe their non-standard, closed source, proprietary “roaming” functionality and this causes great confusion to many people when they enter the world of international standards and open source firmware for their network infrastructure.

    The accepted standard for mesh networks is ieee802.11s.
    The accepted standard for fast roaming of user devices is ieee802.11r.

These are two completely unrelated standards.

## 3. Manual or Auto Configuration:

From version 4.0.0 onwards, the default mode after install is for manual configuration.

***Manual (default) - If you have not done any manual mesh configuration, mesh11sd will do nothing and wait in the background for you to do so.***

***Auto - You can quickly and simply enable auto config mode:***

Switching on Auto Configuration is a simple task and is recommended if you are starting from a basic OpenWrt reflash.

First, make sure your freshly flashed router is connected to your upstream Internet feed using its wan port and that you get Internet access when connected to (one of) its lan ports.

Now, execute the following commands:

```
  service mesh11sd stop
  uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_config='1'
  uci commit mesh11sd
  service mesh11sd start; logread -f
```
You will now see the syslog as mesh11sd starts up (you can press ctrl/c to stop the syslog output).

It checks for a mesh capable wireless driver, a mesh capable wpad package and the presence of nftables bridge support.

If a suitable version of wpad is installed (eg wpad-mesh-mbedtls), mesh11sd adds options to the wireless configuration to bring up 802.11s mesh interfaces, if they are not already present.

**Note**: Mesh11sd uses the uci utility to manage dynamic configuration changes, both autoconfig and run time.

**Note**: Autoconfiguration is done on every startup and is not a one off process.

In normal operation, config changes are not written to the config files in /etc/config but are kept in volatile storage by way of the uci utility.

**Note**: Directly editing a config file might possibly break something, all changes should be done with the uci utility.

**Note**: The OpenWrt Luci web interface does not support mesh11sd configuration and will probably not even show its effects. This is normal.


**Meshnode Types:**

The mesh can have four types of meshnodes.

  1. **Peer Node** - the basic mesh peer - capable of mac-routing layer 2 packets in the mesh network.
  2. **Gateway Node** - a peer node that also hosts an access point (AP) radio for normal client devices to connect to. Also known as a gate. A gate can also function as a CPE (Customer [or Client] Premises Equipment), hosting a downstream layer 3 network with its own unique ipv4 subnet.
  3. **Gateway Leech Node** - a special type of Gateway Node that connects to the mesh backhaul but neither contributes to it nor advertises itself on it.
  4. **Portal Node** - a peer node that also hosts a layer 3 routed upstream connection (eg an Internet feed)

It is possible for a Portal node to also be a Gateway node (ie it hosts an AP as well as an upstream connection.

**Auto Channel Tracking:**

All Peer and Gateway nodes will track the wireless channel that the Portal node is using. If the Portal node changes its working channel, this will be detected and tracked autonomously by downstream meshnodes.

## 4. Installation

It is assumed that the additional dependencies for encrypted mesh and opportunistic wireless encryption (owe) are pre-installed, ie:

    Remove - wpad-basic-mbedtls (or wpad-basic or wpad-basic-wolfssl)

    Install - wpad-mbedtls
         or - wpad-wolfssl
         or - wpad-openssl

If the meshnode device is severely resource limited, support for owe can be dropped by instead installing the size reduced wpad versions, ie:

    Install - wpad-mesh-mbedtls
         or - wpad-mesh-wolfssl
         or - wpad-mesh-openssl

For support of non-mesh segments of backhaul and prevention of bridge loop storms, install the package:

		 kmod-nft-bridge

If this package is not installed, mesh11sd will issue warnings but still function. Omitting this package is not recommended unless node resources are severely restricted.

Installation is achieved in the usual way for OpenWrt, either using the Luci UI, or the opkg command line utility.

**Note**: The OpenWrt Luci web interface does not support mesh11sd configuration and will probably not even show its effects. This is normal.

Example:
```
    opkg update
    opkg install mesh11sd
```

## 5. Configuration
Mesh11sd supports two types of configuration, automatic and manual.

**Manual Configuration (default)**

The default after installation is manual configuration mode. If left in manual mode, all the mesh interface configurations must be done manually in the traditional way using the normal OpenWrt tools. In manual mode, mesh11sd will pick up existing mesh interface configuration from the wireless configuration file and then manage mesh parameter values as required.
If no mesh configuration is found, mesh11sd will do nothing and wait for a configuration to appear.

**Automatic Configuration**

Once auto_config is enabled, the mesh11sd package will autoconfigure mesh interfaces for all radios, leaving only one enabled at ant time.

The default radio will be on 2.4 GHz but can be changed by means of a simple config option.

2.4 GHz is chosen as it gives the most reliable mesh backhaul due to the range and penetration of the 2.4 GHz spectrum and the fact that it is not effected by the DFS restrictions of other bands. It can also be used unlicensed almost everywhere in outdoor venues. This comes of course with a likely bandwidth compromise, but in practice is often acceptable, particularly in a normal domestic or public environment.

Mesh11sd will add required wireless mesh configuration autonomously and it can be viewed using the uci utility but will not be present in the /etc/config/wireless file.

If the mesh network interface is defined in the wireless configuration file, mesh11sd will attempt to use it, but be warned, this may have very unpredictable results and is not normally recommended.

**NOTE:** ***Mesh11sd cannot be configured using the OpenWrt Luci UI, and its configuration will not appear in the Luci wireless pages, even when mesh11sd is active.***

**NOTE:** It is essential that all meshnodes are configured to use the same radio channel, the same key and the same mesh_id. By default, Mesh11sd will do this for you.

###Autoconfig Essentials

***Note: Use the same configuration for all nodes, including the base ipv4 address.***

By simply enabling auto_config, mesh11sd will bring up a working meshnode, but there are several essentials that should be configured as the defaults may not be appropriate.

 1. The country code default setting is DFS-ETSI as it is the "safest", but of course you are legally obliged to set the country code for your locality.
 2. Set the base ipv4 address of the meshnode, defining the subnet to be used on the mesh.
 3. Mesh11sd sets a hashed meshID and meshKey to encrypt the mesh backhaul, but you should set your own seed values to be used, to ensure only your meshnodes can join your mesh. This must be the same on every meshnode.
 4. You should set a WiFi access code and if desired, your own ssid on each gateway node.


Before proceeding to set these essentials, you must first connect each node in turn to an upstream Internet connection, connecting its "wan" port to a "lan" port of your isp router.

Connect your computer by ethernet to a "lan" port of the meshnode you are configuring.

Open a terminal session on the node using SSH to the default ip address of 192.168.1.1

You must now stop the mesh11sd service using the following command:

```
	service mesh11sd stop
```

**Country Code**

This should be set in the normal OpenWrt way, using either the uci utility or the Luci Web UI.

**Base IP Addrress and Subnet Mask**

This should be set in the normal OpenWrt way, using either the uci utility or the Luci Web UI.

**Mesh Encryption Seed Values**

A mesh ID seed value should be set. For example, using the string "MyMeshIDSeed", run the following command:

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_mesh_id='MyMeshIDSeed'
```

Optionally add a mesh key seed, eg "MyMeshKeySeed"

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.auto_mesh_key='MyMeshKeySeed'
```

**Gateway SSID**

This should be set in the normal OpenWrt way, using either the uci utility or the Luci Web UI.

**Gateway Encryption**

First, select the desired encryption type from the following:

`0 (none/owe-transition), 1 (sae, aka wpa3), 2 (sae-mixed, aka wpa2/wpa3), 3 (psk2, aka wpa2) or 4 (owe - Opportunistic Wireless Encryption)`

**Note: Opportunistic Wireless Encryption requires a full version of wpad eg wpad-mbedtls.**

Example, set to psk2 encryption:

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_encryption='3'
```

Now set the desired access code, eg "mysecretaccesscode":

```
	uci set mesh11sd.setup.mesh_gate_key='mysecretaccesscode'
```

**Save the Changes**

Finally, save the changes:

```
	uci commit mesh11sd

```

The node can now be moved to the desired location and the next one configured.

Power up all nodes in any order, having one only connected to your isp router as the portal node.

All mesh parameter settings in the config file are dynamic and will take effect immediately.

**NOTE:** The setup option `portal_detect` is set to 1 (enabled) by default.

**NOTE:** If the setup option `portal_detect` is set to 0, the meshnode will be forced into Portal mode. ie it will act as a layer 3 router between its wan and lan ports regardless of the availability of an upstream wan feed.

**NOTE:** If the setup option `portal_detect` is set to 2, the meshnode will be forced into Peer mode, ignoring any any upstream wan feed.

**NOTE:** If the setup option `portal_detect` is set to 3, the meshnode will be forced into CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) mode, The mesh backhaul will be used as a wan connection and the meshnode will function as an ipv4 NAT router with a unique ipv4 subnet on its lan and mesh gate (access point).

The option portal_detect much simplifies the setup of the meshnodes of a network. Each can be configured as a basic router with a mesh interface defined as above. Once mesh11sd is installed, portal detection will be activated and with the upstream wan port connected, the meshnode will continue to function as a router with the additional functionality of a mesh portal.

When the upstream wan connection is disconnected, the meshnode will automatically reconfigure itself as a layer 2 peer meshnode.

This means that all meshnodes can be the same basic router configuration and once moved to the required location, will autonomously reconfigure.

Access to the remote meshnode peers will not be possible using the default ipv4 address as this will be disabled. Remote management can be achieved by using the `mesh11sd connect` and `mesh11sd copy` commands, or alternatively by reconnecting the wan port to an upstream feed.


## 6. Setup Options
* enabled - 0=disabled, 1=enabled. Default 1

* debuglevel - 0=silent, 1=notice, 2=info, 3=debug. Default 1

* checkinterval - the interval in seconds after which changes in parameters are detected and activated. Default 10 seconds

* portal_detect - (optional, default 1)  Detect if the meshnode is a portal, meaning it has an upstream wan link. If the upstream link is active, the router hosting the meshnode will serve ipv4 dhcp into the mesh network. If the upstream link is not connected, dhcp will be disabled and the meshnode will function as a level 2 bridge on the mesh network. Default 1 (enabled). Set to 0 to force Portal mode, 2 to force Peer mode, or 3 to enable CPE mode.

* portal_channel - valid only when the meshnode is a portal. Specifies the mesh network working channel. All other meshnodes will track this channel.

* interface_timeout - the time in seconds that mesh11sd will wait for a mesh interface to establish before continuing. Default 10 seconds

* mesh_path_cost - sets the STP cost of the mesh network. Default: 10. Can be set to any value from 0 to 65534. Setting to 0 disables STP

* auto_config - (optional) - autonomously configures the mesh network. Default 1 (enabled). Set to 0 to disable

* auto_mesh_id - (optional) - specifies a string used to generate the mesh id hash. If set, this must be the same on all mesh nodes. Default --__

* auto_mesh_band - (optional) - specifies the wireless band to be used for the mesh network. Possible values are 2g, 5g, 6g and 60g. Default 2g

* auto_mesh_key - specifies a seed value string to be used in generating the mesh key hash used for mesh encryption. If set, this must be the same on all meshnodes. Default not set

* auto_mesh_network - (optional) - specifies the firewall zone used for the mesh. Typical values "lan", "guest" etc. This can be set differently on each meshnode as required. Firewall zone "wan" is not valid. Default lan

* mesh_basename - (optional) The first 4 characters after non alphanumerics (ie special characters) are removed are used as the mesh_basename. The mesh_basename is used to construct a unique mesh interface name of the form m-xxxx-n. Default: 11s

* mesh_gate_enable - enables any access points configured on the meshnode. Default 1 (enabled). Set to 0 to disable. **Note:** If there is an interface level "disable option" (in wireless config), mesh11sd will use that setting.

* mesh_gate_encryption - Determines whether this node's gate will be a encrypted. Default: 0 (disabled). Set to 0 (none/owe-transition), 1 (sae, aka wpa3), 2 (sae-mixed, aka wpa2/wpa3), 3 (psk2, aka wpa2) or 4 (Opportunistic Wireless Encryption - owe).

* mesh_gate_key - Determines the encryption key for this node's gate. Default: not set (encryption disabled or owe). Set to a secret string value to use for encrypting the node's gate

* mesh_leechmode_enable - Determines whether this node will be a gate only leech node. A gate only leech node acts as an access point with a mesh backhaul connection, but does not contribute to the mesh. This is useful when a node is well within the coverage of 2 or more peer nodes, as otherwise it could create unstable multi hop paths within the backhaul. Default: 0 (disabled). Set to 1 to enable (turns off the node's mesh forwarding and HWMP mac-routing).

* mesh_path_stabilisation - This enables mesh path stabilisation, preventing multi hop path changes due to multipath signal strength jitter. Default: 1 (enabled). To disable, set to zero.

* txpower - set the mesh radio transmit power in dBm. Takes effect immediately.

* ssid_suffix_enable - Add a 4 digit suffix to the ssid. The 4 digits are the last 4 digits of the mac address of the mesh interface.

* watchdog_nonvolatile_log - (optional - FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES ONLY). This enables logging of the portal detect watchdog actions in non-volatile storage. The log file /mesh11sd_log/mesh11sd.log is created. THIS OPTION IS FOR PORTAL DETECT WATCHDOG DEBUGGING PURPOSES ONLY. IF LEFT ENABLED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME IT MAY CAUSE NONE REPAIRABLE FLASH MEMORY WEAR AND USE UP FREE STORAGE SPACE. DISABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEBUGGING OPERATIONS ARE COMPLETE.


**Example**:
Set the debuglevel to 2

        uci set mesh11sd.setup.debuglevel='2'

Debuglevel will be set immediately to level 2 "info" and will remain set until changed again or a reboot occurs.

Changes can be made permanent with the following command:

        uci commit mesh11sd

## 7. Mesh Parameter Options


Mesh parameters can be changed only while the mesh is active.

Here is a list of available parameters and their function:

 * mesh_retry_timeout: the initial retry timeout in millisecond units used by the Mesh Peering Open message

 * mesh_min_discovery_timeout: the minimum length of time to wait until giving up on a path discovery in milliseconds

 * mesh_hwmp_active_path_timeout: the time in milliseconds for which mesh STAs receiving a PREQ shall consider the forwarding information from the root to be valid.

 * mesh_hwmp_preq_min_interval: the minimum interval of time in milliseconds during which a mesh STA can send only one action frame containing a PREQ element

 * mesh_hwmp_net_diameter_traversal_time: the interval of time in milliseconds that it takes for an HWMP (Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol) information element to propagate across the mesh

 * mesh_hwmp_rootmode: the configuration of a mesh STA as root mesh STA

 * mesh_hwmp_rann_interval: the interval of time in milliseconds between root announcements (rann - RootANNouncement)

 * mesh_gate_announcements: whether to advertise that this mesh station has access to a broader network beyond the MBSS (Mesh Basic Service Set, a self-contained network of mesh stations that share a mesh profile)

 * mesh_fwding: whether the Mesh STA is forwarding or non-forwarding

 * mesh_rssi_threshold: the threshold for average signal strength of candidate station to establish a peer link

 * mesh_hwmp_active_path_to_root_timeout: The time in milliseconds for which mesh STAs receiving a proactive PREQ shall consider the forwarding information to the root mesh STA to be valid

 * mesh_hwmp_root_interval: The interval of time in milliseconds between proactive PREQs

 * mesh_hwmp_confirmation_interval: The minimum interval of time in milliseconds during which a mesh STA can send only one Action frame containing a PREQ element for root path confirmation

 * mesh_power_mode: The default mesh power save mode which will be the initial setting for new peer links

 * mesh_awake_window: The duration in milliseconds the STA will remain awake after transmitting its beacon

 * mesh_plink_timeout: If no tx activity is seen from a peered STA for longer than this time (in seconds), then remove it from the STA's list of peers.  Default is 0, equating to 30 minutes

 * mesh_connected_to_as: if set to true then this mesh STA will advertise in the mesh station information field that it is connected to a captive portal authentication server, or in the simplest case, an upstream router

 * mesh_connected_to_gate: if set to true then this mesh STA will advertise in the mesh station information field that it is connected to a separate network infrastucture such as a wireless network or downstream router

 * mesh_nolearn: Try to avoid multi-hop path discovery if the destination is a direct neighbour. Note that this will not be optimal as multi-hop mac-routes will not be discovered. If using this setting, disable mesh forwarding and use another mesh routing protocol

## 8. Command Line Interface
Mesh11sd is an OpenWrt service daemon and runs continuously in the background. It does however also have a CLI interface:

      Usage: mesh11sd [option] [argument...]]

        Option: -h --help help
          Returns: This help information

        Option: -v --version version
          Returns: The mesh11sd version

        Option: debuglevel
          Argument: 0 - silent, 1 - notice, 2 - info, 3 - debug
          Returns: The mesh11sd debug level

        Option: enable
          Returns: "1" and exit code 0 if successful, exit code 1 if was already enabled

        Option: disable
          Returns: "0" and exit code 0 if successful, exit code 1 if was already disabled

        Option: status
          Returns: the mesh status in json format

  	    Option: connect
		  Connect a remote terminal session on a remote meshnode
		  Usage: mesh11sd connect [remote_meshnode_macaddress]
 		 	If the remote meshnode mac address is omitted, a list of meshnode mac addresses available for connection is listed.

        Option: copy
		  Copy a file to /tmp/ on a remote meshnode
		  Usage: mesh11sd copy [remote_meshnode_macaddress] [path_of_source_file]
			If the remote meshnode mac address is null, or both arguments are omitted, a list of meshnode mac addresses available for copy is listed.

        Option: txpower
          Change the mesh transmit power
          Usage: mesh11sd txpower [+|-]
          where \"+\" increments by 3dBm and \"-\" decrements by 3dBm
          Takes effect immediately

        Option: mesh_leechmode
          Change leechmode status
          Usage: mesh11sd mesh_leechmode [enable/disable]
          Takes effect immediately

        Option: stations
          List all mesh peer stations directly connected to this mesh peer station (one hop)
          Usage: mesh11sd stations

        Option: mesh_rssi_threshold
          Change the mesh rssi threshold
          Usage: mesh11sd mesh_rssi_threshold [+|-] [force]
          where \"+\" increments by 3dBm and \"-\" decrements by 3dBm
          Takes effect immediately on NEW connections
          The keyword \"force\" forces the new threshold on all connected peers
          Warning - \"force\" will briefly remove this node from the mesh network, taking a few seconds to rejoin

        Option: commit_changes
          Usage: mesh11sd commit_changes
          Commits changes to mesh_leechmode, txpower and rssi_threshold to non volatile configuration (make permanent)

        Option: opkg_force_ipv4
          Usage: mesh11sd opkg_force_ipv4
          Forces opkg to use ipv4 for its downloads

        Option: opkg_revert_to_default
          Usage: mesh11sd opkg_revert_to_default
          Reverts opkg to default for its downloads
